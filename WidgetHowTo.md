A widget _definition_ is a Java class that extends `se.sparkwi.web.module.WidgetDefinition`. The standard set of widgets are defined in the package `se.sparkwi.web.widget`. To create a new data collection widget, create a new class (in that package) that implements what ever logic you need the back end service to do. For now, take a look at the existing widgets for examples. Documentation is in the works.

SparkwiseOS is provided with connection adapters for Facebook Flickr, Google, Picasa, Twitter, Vimeo and You Tube. If your widgets requires a new connection type, just take a look at the existing classes in `se.sparkwi.web.module.auth.type` and make a new class like the existing. Then you must pass the deployment.properties through to your class from `se.sparkwi.web.module.auth.OAuthorizationModule`. Finally, add a static constant for your widget definition at `se.sparkwi.web.module.auth.ConnectionAPI`.
