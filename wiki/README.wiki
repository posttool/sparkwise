=Sparkwise README=

_The code base is in the process of being checked in... Java code is available in truck/src, the Javascript/HTML is coming soon. Contact info is at the bottom of this document if you would like to discuss._

The Sparkwise application requires a server configured with the following software:

  * Java 6 or 7
  * BerkeleyDB 4.7 with Java bindings
  * ImageMagick
  * Tomcat 6 (or compatible web container)

The following configuration will work for Debian/Ubuntu:
{{{
# apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk
# apt-get install tomcat6
# apt-get install libdb4.7-java
# apt-get install imagemagick
}}}
