= Introduction =

SparkwiseOS is the open source code used to run the online free service http://sparkwi.se

It can be set up and run on any Linux, Windows or Mac in a development and production mode. It is developed in Java and Javascript, mostly. SparkwiseOS relies on plenty of other open source [Dependencies dependencies] which are distributed with the project.

=Architecture=
The Sparkwise application is comprised of a user interface, the dashboard data services and third party integration points. The [DashboardAPI Dashboard API] contains a list of the data services, which are intended to be client agnostic. The services can been called as JSON or AMF (other gateways could be added as well). Users create Dashboard of Widgets. In the diagram below, the queue is created from a list of widgets that need to get fresh data.

Once registered, users are able to _connect_ with third party sources. For each connection, the user can create instances of _widgets_ which are arranged in _dashboards_. Widgets are composed of display properties and a _data proxy_. The data proxy consists of of a connection, a widget definition and data _selector_ settings, for example: 'Google Analytics connection for Bob', 'Get Unique Visitors', 'subgenius.com'.

Take a look at the [DashboardEntities entities] for a complete overview of the data structures returned from the API.

Widgets go through many states as they are set up and as they collect data over time. Following is a simplified overview of the process. More detail can be seen at [WidgetStates widget states].

=Setup=

SparkwiseOS aggregates data from a variety of sources on behalf of registered users. In order to do this, the third party services require that we get API keys from them. Follow the [SetupKeys setup instructions] to create  OAuth application keys with third party services, such as Google Analytics and Facebook. For more information on OAuth, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth

Setting up a development environment or server is simple. Take a look at SetupDevelopment and SetupServer for more information.

=Code=

The server side code is written in Java and runs under the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Servlet Servlet 2.4] specification. Most of the data services are represented in {{{se.sparkwi.web.module.DashboardModule}}} which is loaded on startup by {{{WEB-INF/config/application.xml}}}.
