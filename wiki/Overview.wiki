= Introduction =

SparkwiseOS is the open source code used to run the online free service http://sparkwi.se

It can be set up and run on any Linux, Windows or Mac in a development and production mode. It is developed in Java and Javascript, mostly. SparkwiseOS relies on plenty of other open source [Dependencies dependencies] which are distributed with the project.

=Architecture=

Once registered, users _connect_ with third party sources. For each connection, the user can create instances of _widgets_ which are arranged in _dashboards_. Widgets are composed of display properties and a _data proxy_. The data proxy consists of of a connection, a widget definition and data _selector_ settings, for example: 'Google Analytics connection for Bob', 'Get Unique Visitors', 'http://www.subgenius.com'.

=Setup=

SparkwiseOS aggregates data from a variety of sources on behalf of registered users. In order to do this, the third party services require that we get API keys from them. Follow the [SetupKeys setup instructions] to create  OAuth application keys with third party services, such as Google Analytics and Facebook. For more information on OAuth, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth

Setting up a development environment or server is simple. Take a look at SetupDevelopment and SetupServer for more information.
