(assumes Java 6 is installed)

===Eclipse===

http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/helios/SR2/eclipse-jee-helios-SR2-macosx-cocoa.tar.gz

Once installed, start it up and add subversion (subclipse) with these instructions (using the update manager) http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectProcess?pageID=p4wYuA 

===Initial Import===

Restart Eclipse (as prompted) go to File > Import > SVN > Checkout project from SVN

Add  the Google code repository and then checkout the project.

===Tomcat===

  * Download tomcat 6 (core binary) at http://tomcat.apache.org/download-60.cgi
  * Extract it to you applications directory (or anywhere, really)
  * Now tell Eclipse about it- go to File > New > Other > server
  * In the wizard choose Apache Tomcat 6
  * Next to 'server runtime environment' click 'Add'
  * in the 'new runtime' popup, browse to the Tomcat installation 
  * click next
  * from 'Add and Remove', add Sparkwise to the right side
  * click finish

===BDB===

Download and extract
http://download.oracle.com/berkeley-db/db-4.7.25.tar.gz

From the command line / terminal

{{{
#cd /path/to/db-4.7.25 
#cd build_unix
#../dist/configure --enable-java
#make
#make install
}}}

You also might need to tell Java about BDB
{{{
#ln -s /usr/lib/BerkeleyDB/lib/libdb_java..  /Library/Java/Extentions
}}}

===ImageMagick===

Download
http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#macosx

{{{
#sudo ipfw add 100 fwd 127.0.0.1,8080 tcp from any to any 80 in
}}}


Eclipse, WebApp Config


back to eclipse...

add environment variables to the run configurations for resizing images
go to run > run configurations â€¦
click on the tomcat v6 at localhost configuration
click the environment variables tab
add these:
MAGICK_HOME                 /Applications/ImageMagick-6.6.X 
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH     /Applications/ImageMagick-6.6.X/lib

in the 'package explorer' navigate to and open
SWAGroupServer/WebContent/WEB-INF/config/deployment.properties
the one that is there by default needs to be modified for your user
and your bdb environment, tomcat as well as image magick, etc.
modify this file, but don't check it in, please. 
if you want to check in you deployments, copy the working version
and check it in as deployment.btatham.properties
