Restart Eclipse (as prompted) go to File > Import > SVN > Checkout project from SVN

Add  the Google code repository and then checkout the project.

  * Download tomcat 6 (core binary) at http://tomcat.apache.org/download-60.cgi
  * Extract it to you applications directory (or anywhere, really)
  * Now tell Eclipse about it- go to File > New > Other > server

#cd build_unix
#../dist/configure --enable-java

Eclipse, WebApp Config


back to eclipse...

add environment variables to the run configurations for resizing images
go to run > run configurations …
click on the tomcat v6 at localhost configuration
click the environment variables tab
add these:
MAGICK_HOME                 /Applications/ImageMagick-6.6.X 
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH     /Applications/ImageMagick-6.6.X/lib

in the 'package explorer' navigate to and open
SWAGroupServer/WebContent/WEB-INF/config/deployment.properties
the one that is there by default needs to be modified for your user
and your bdb environment, tomcat as well as image magick, etc.
modify this file, but don't check it in, please. 
if you want to check in you deployments, copy the working version
and check it in as deployment.btatham.properties
